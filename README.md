# notesApp
In this App I've learned Activity life cycle , activity state management and storing datas into bundle and retriving them back, when we are changing states (like a device is being rotated). I'm constantly adding more functionalities to the app (like permanent data storage for the USERS with SQLite db and so on).

The Work is still going on and will be finished soon.
